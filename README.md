## Committing to Documentation: [The Template](https://ctodocs.github.io/futureDocs/)!
This site is the template for the workshop [Committing to Documentation](https://ctodocs.github.io/ctod/), created by Genevieve Havemeyer-King, Alison Rhonemus, and Nick Krabbenhoeft. 

- Making a change with a single line


## This is my first header

### Smaller section here
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
    - Step 3 has you `running one tiny command`
    - After you run that code, confirm something
    - Great job on that confirmation


### Acknowledgment
- I am apologizing for not having proper content to share with you today
- Though the documentation tips are very helpful
- Markdown is super easy, but, too many bullets in the .md world


### Giant code block

```
whole bunch of like.... python stuff or other stuff
import json
import csv
import requests

baseURL = ''
user = ''

print ('This kind of looks real, right?')
```
